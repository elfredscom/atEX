Blogs have a monthly limit on the charge. So you are only charged for the time duration until you hit the limit. This prevents very high charge amount for heavy/regular readers of the blog. Users do not have to do anything but the ‘cap’ is set for every blog. Kindly note that every blog has a separate 'cap'. If you follow and read multiple blogs/publishers, your monthly charges may go well beyong 6 US Dollars.

All the charges and payments are processed and presented in USD cents only. This is done to standardise the charges and accounting. Kindly keep the comparative local pricing in mind while using any blog to estimate the cost and value of service to you.

**Why am I required to keep a prepaid balance?**

Prepaid balance is required to ensure that all the charges for blogs you read are paid. Alternative models increase the cost of providing the services, which are eventually borne by the paying users. Moreover, the unused prepaid balance is always refundable at the time of account closure.
