# Documentation

The docs guide you through all you need to know to integrate EXYZ in your website and provide a paid option to your users. We recommend you to read it completely. We encourage you to contact exyz@elfreds.com if you need any further assistance.

****What is EXYZ?****

EXYZ is a blogging platform that allows writers to provide a paid option for their content. Users are charged based how much time they spend reading your blog upto 3 hours and a monthly charge of USD 6.

****How does it work?****

Readers add balance to their EXYZ Wallet and start reading paid posts. As they spend time on the post, money is transferred from reader's wallet to writer's wallet. 

****EXYZ advantage****

EXYZ eanbles higher adoption due to lack of any upfront paywall. Even as a paid option, users are charged per their usage.

Reader is charged at a rate but a monthly limit exists per blog. So any usage beyond the limit is not charged. Ideal because high value readers need to be encouraged with a fix amount of charge. Redaers will be charged at the rate if their usage is less than standard.

****Units****

All the transactions and payments are processed and presented in USD cents.

All the session are tracked and charges calculated on the basis of duration for which blog is read in seconds.

****EXYZ's charge of service****

A standard deduction of 10% is made from total revenue of blog. EXYZâ€™s deduction is inclusive of payment processing and all other charges. So 90% of charge is transferred to the creator in full.

However, we estimate a 2% loss of sessions' data (partial or complete) due to disconnections, reporting and server errors, and other technical limitations. Such data may never reach us and we cannot process the same. Neither you nor we can receive any charge for such loss. Although, EXYZ employs best procedures to minimise such loss, we recommend you to account for same.
