#### What is EXYZ?

EXYZ is a publishing platform where you can start a page with $6 monthly subscriptions. But viewers don't pay anything upfront. 
Viewers add money to their EXYZ wallet and as they spend time watching your posts, money starts to move to you. You can see details at [Pricing](https://exyz.elfreds.com/pricing).

#### 5% Stop Rate for Meter Paywalls

95% readers not paying for upto 5 articles they read (industry average). With EXYZ, this readership segment can help you earn much more.

#### Growth over and above the existig paywall revenue

The revenue growth is completely above the existing paywall revenue.

#### Less burden per reader with higher conversion

To grow revenue, higher conversion is tapped so readers can be more flexible with their usage. 
This means higher subscription revenue even with an Average Revenue Per Subscriber (ARPS) less than $1 in comparison to an ARPS of say $5 in case of paywall subscription.

#### Why do this?

Most of the reading has turned to digital mediums and ad revenues have plummeted. The problem with paywalls is:

Readers have a lot of sources and they can't go around paying everyone of the publications $5 for subscription. 
This can work for you if you can provide lots of content every month and have a large readership willing to pay for it (like NYT and Stratechery).

If readers have the option to access paid content but only pay as much as they read, many more readers shall.

#### How can EXYZ solve this?

EXYZ allows reader to have a single account and subscribe/read multiple publications. 
If the reader reads only one or two of your posts in a month, they are charged a few cents in that month.
If you post a lot (like a publication) and your readers read most of it (specifically, atleast 3 hours), you earn the full subscription price.

You earn from every one of your post. Your best writings (which most readers would value) need not be given out as 3 free articles per month or be accessible at a full subscription cost.
If many people are willing to read just one of that trending piece, you better earn on that as much as you should.

EXYZ aims to build a community. 
Firstly, we aim to build a direct relation between the writers and readers (unlike social media curation) such that readers subscribe to publications they value.
Also, we provide some discovery features that can help publications writing valuable content and readers willing to pay for it find each other.

EXYZ removes all the friction from subscriptions.
Readers don't have to make separate payments or decide upfront whether to subscribe to any publication or pay for any post. 
Instead, the money flows automatically when the real interaction between the publication and reader (that is reading) happens.

#### Who is EXYZ for?

We built EXYZ with independent bloggers, newsletter writers, and publications in mind. 
EXYZ is the home where you can build a community of readers who value your work by working alongside other publishers.
Unlike an Apple News or a Medium.com subscription (no hard feeling for these beautiful platforms but their revenue model), 
publishers don't have to compete for a piece of the pie, but can earn their own pie while helping the community grow as a whole.

#### How does EXYZ help?

Instead of building notifications everywhere, 
we build EXYZ to simply be a home to your posts like a publication but can you bring in your readers from Twitter, Facebook, Substack, and everywhere else by linking your posts there.

EXYZ only exists with your content. Instead of promoting things about us, we make our Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Substack, and our ad campaigns about your posts, 
things that people would love to read.

If you need any help bringing your previous content here or provide feedback regarding things you would like us add, please email us at exyz@elfreds.com
