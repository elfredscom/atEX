### Funding 

EXYZ is a bootstrapped project currently in the process of being incorporated as a US C Corporation.

We are focused on adding product features at the moment and have not raised any round of funding yet. However, this project is a perfect fit for high growth venture and funding can certainly help us speed up the development process. 

If you feel excited about its possibilities as much as we do, you belong with us! Reach us at [exyz@elfreds.com](mailto:exyz@elfreds.com) and lets build together!

### Current Developments

We currently have three big things in pipeline: 
- Video Blogs,
- Ad-Supported Access,
- and monetisation widget for websites!

As our mission, we seek to empower creators and publishers with flexible monetisation tools that can help them earn while reaching the widest audiences for their digital content (text or video).
